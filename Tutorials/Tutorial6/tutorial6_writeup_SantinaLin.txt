Our SVM performs perfectly well when we use linear model in SVM. SVM has 100% accuracy with 'kernel = "linear"' and Naive Bayes has 96% accuracy. When we use 'kernel = "polynomial' for SVM, however, the accuracy was bad; in fact, all data was classified to be class 1.  It's most likely because polynomial model can overfit the training data, and then perform badly on the testing data.  

Strangely, changing the degree for type polynimal in svm to 1 still generates the same result as the default parameter 'degree = 3'. So setting the kernal to 'polynomial' makes svm behave differently from that with kernel set to 'linear'. 

From reading the svm documentation ('?svm') there is a extra gamma variable that is not present in the linear equation. Therefore, polynomial method does follow a different fomula than the linear model.
