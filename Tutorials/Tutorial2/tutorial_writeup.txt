Tutorial 2: Classification comparison  - Sept 29, 2014 Monday 4pm 

In class we did a few classifications methods such as : 

1. using 'class' method to classify based on different (set of) terms
  a. "also"  as a vague classification term 
  b. (all terms) to build model on all terms 
  c. ' camera + car ' as a way to give clear way to classify documents 

In 1a, the documents were split in which 27 documents belong to the camera group were split into two groups with 19 and 8 documents inside them. The documents belong to the car group were split into two separate group, with 17 and 6 documents respectively. It is to demonstrate a bad classification. 

In 1b, the documents were correctly divided into 27 documents in group 1 (camera) and 23 in group 2 (cars)

In 1c, the result was the same as 1b. It was expected that the two key words would give rise to better classification result than a random term like in 1a. 

2. Using poisson and anova to run the test 

When using either all terms or combination of "camera" and "car", the both classification methods gave rise to correct classification results. 

When using a random term such as "also", both methods mistakenly put 8 camera documents into another class and 6 car documents into a different one as well. Both with about the same degree of uncertainty (see below)

POISSON, classify with "also"

    1.44330484330484 1.59759299781182
  1               19                8
  2               17                6

ANOVA

    1.44285714285714 1.6
  1               19   8
  2               17   6

I think it's interesting that both methods has intermediate values for the categories (1 and 2) they classify the documents into. That give a bit more extra information than the "class" method. Overall, I learn that all methods perform with about the same accuracy when the model is trained on important key words.
