It's hard to identify what would be the right number of clusters, given that K clusters are
formed randomly based on randomy selection of seeds. The results thus differ each time
you run a k clustering analysis on a data set. In the case of a very clear split 
of data into different sets, the best results can be clear after running ita few times and 
testing different number of seeds. However, in the case of a data set in which the divisions
aren't clear cut, it's hard to find the most optimal solution even after running a few times.

Generally speaking, a good k-mean clustering can divide a data set into k groups such that 
the variance within each group is small. Ignore the fact that the seeds are random
as we increase k, the variance should decrease until the level of decreases become smaller,
meaning that the algorithm has divide the data set into a good number of groups. 
However, the variance converges to zero as we incease k (until k = number of data points 
in the set) so we need to be careful with the k we choose.
