Tutorial 3: Linear regression - Oct 6, 2014 Monday 4pm 

In this tutorial, we built a linear model using a training data set and examined how good it fits with a testing data set. The work flow was: 

1. Build a linear model on training data set
2. examine the linear equation 
3. look at residuals of the models (hist(resid(model))) 
4. Use the model to make a prediction (predict()) 
5. compare actual values with the predicted value side by side 
6. scale the data 
7. check to see if linear model fits better 
	- by looking at the values side by side 
	- look at sum of residuals 

The first fitted model was price based on variables "area" and "bedrooms", denoted as P, A, and B, respectively : 

P = 136.9A - 14085B + 108413  
Sum of residuals is : 51688.15 

The second fitted model, after the variables (area and bedroom) have been scaled such that new_value = (old_value - mean) / SD of the variable, became this: 

P = 114289A - 11079B + 342997 
Sum of residuals is : 39722.82 

As we can see that, the variable A (area) is weighted a lot more in the second one, fitted on a scaled data set, than the first one. The second model which was built on a scaled training data also has a smaller residuals, suggesting better fitting linear regression model 

I believe it's because in the original data, area is a larger number (1000+) and bedroom is a smaller number (1, 2, 3). So scaling the number will make them more representative and address the problem of different units. Now we can see that total area is a more deterministic factor for the housing price.
